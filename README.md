# Violent Crimes in India
This project has been made in R, a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
## Overview
India has over 28 states and 7 UTs. The available data gives us a detailed information of the 4 violent crimes, Robbery, Riots, Arson and Dowry Deaths, for the years 2004-2014 and for each of the 35 States/UTs. This data is plotted as a scatter plot, creating 4 graphs for each state-one each for Robbery, Riots, Arson and Dowry Deaths. A linear regression line is then fit on the data. This linear regression model is used to fit the data for the state for a particular crime. This is then used to make projections of the crime in the years to come.
## Results
The map below is based on the projected incidence of crimes under various categories assuming that these states maintain their torrid crime rate. A close look at the Predicted no. of crimes clearly indicate **Maharashtra** to be the state with most violent crimes in the upcoming years, followed by **Bihar** and **Uttar Pradesh**, repectively.
